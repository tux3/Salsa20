Salsa20
=======

A homemade Salsa20/20 implementation in masm32 ASM

Note that this code is NOT optimized and has NOT been thoroughly checked.
It Works On My Machine, but please use an official implementation (such as one from <a hred="http://cr.yp.to/snuffle.html">this page</a>) for any serious project.

An example test file is provided to show the basic use of the API.
